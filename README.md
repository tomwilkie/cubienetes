## Assembly

First versions of the hard disk brackets didn't quite fit:

I did a full build to get a handle on the cabling too:

Problems were:
- The SSD mounting hole pitch was off by 0.5mm.
- The walls around the pillars meant the distance between the pillars was too small.
- The bore of all the holes (3mm) was too tight for M3 threaded rod and needed drilling out.  Surprisingly the Shapeways white plastic took this quite well.

So I created & new design and ordered that:

And with the router & PSU double-sided-sticky taped on, and cables all cable-tied:

## Software

### Operating System

- Used Debian Jessie from https://www.armbian.com/cubieboard-2/
- Use [Keka](http://www.kekaosx.com/en/) and [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) to decompress / write the image.
- Use the latest kernel you can - Docker needs it.

### Manual setup

For ansible to work, I setup password-less ssh:

```
mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
echo "<REDACTED>" > ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

I did this manually.  I also statically assigned IP addresses 192.168.0.1-5 to the Cubieboards manually.  The rest was configured with ansible.

### Automated setup

I designated the first Cubieboard as the "master", and set it up to do NAT routing & DNS as it also has a WiFi adapter.

```
ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory --user=root custom-playbooks/networking.yaml
```

The disks got LVM & ext4 installed and mounted at /mnt/countainers:

```
ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory --user=root custom-playbooks/disks.yaml
```

And the hostnames were all set and put in /etc/hosts:

```
ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory --user=root custom-playbooks/hostname.yaml
```

### Docker Daemon

- Used [Hypriot's instructions](http://blog.hypriot.com/post/family_arm_hardware_for_docker_more_children/)
- https://packagecloud.io/app/Hypriot/Schatzkiste/search?filter=all&q=docker-hypriot&dist=debian%2Fjessie

```
ansible-playbook --inventory-file=inventory --user=root custom-playbooks/docker.yaml
```
